NOTE: When calculating the Coleman-Liau index, the L and S need to be calculated as float (i.e. w to be casted to float)
      Along with this first the raw_index in float needs to be calculated then that needs to be rounded to the closest value
      using the round function in math.h


1. Getting Input
    get_string()
    printf()
2. Count letters
    take string and loop through the chars until you reach null character
        if the char is between A-Z (ASCII 65 - 90) or a-z (ASCII 97-122)
        [Uses strcmp() from string.h]
            increment count
3. Count Words
        Elegant and simple solution
    while the end of string is not reached
        if the text rn is a space(ascii 32)
            if the text before was not a space(ascii 32)
                word count is incremented by 1
        if end of string reached
            add 1 to word count
4. Sentence Count
    while the end of string is not reached
        if the text rn is a '.' or '!' or '?'
            if the text before was not a '.' or '!' or '?'
                sentence count is incremented by 1
